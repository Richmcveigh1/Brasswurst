      Brasswürst Bavarian Band is a not so authentic German oompah band, that provides the drinking songs, dances
      and atmosphere from a Bavarian Bierkeller with the sound track of your favourite parties in a distinctivally Mancunian Oompah style. The band consists of five full time professional musicians based in
      the North West of England. We consist of a Clarinet, Trumpet, Trombone,
      Sousaphone and Drums, each of which ready to bring the energy to any event that wants to sing and dance along as part of the Brasswürst family!

      Brasswürst began in 2012 when five talented musicians graduated from
      the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and as a group they
      have had the opportunity to take centre stage all over the country. The
      band are always up for a laugh and get the crowds dancing, swaying,
      drinking and singing along to their favourite tunes. If you thought you liked Bratwurst, just wait until you taste Brasswürst. Prost!
