      Brasswürst Bavarian Band is a not so authentic German oompah band, that provides the drinking songs, dances
      and atmosphere from a Bavarian Bierkeller with the sound track of your favourite parties in a distinctivally Mancunian Oompah style. The band consists of five full time professional musicians based in
      the North West of England. We consist of a Clarinet, Trumpet, Trombone,
      Sousaphone and Drums, each of which ready to bring the energy to any event that wants to sing and dance along as part of the Brasswürst family!
    </p>

      Brasswürst began in 2012 when these five talented musicians graduated from
      the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and as a group they
      have had the opportunity to take centre stage all over the country. The
      band are always up for a laugh and get the crowds dancing, swaying,
      drinking and singing along to their favourite tunes. If you thought you liked Bratwurst, just wait until you taste Brasswürst. Prost!
