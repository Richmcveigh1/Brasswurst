    <p>
      Brasswürst Bavarian Band is an authentic German oompah band, that provides
      classic German drinking songs mixed with modern songs with an oompah
      twist. The band consists of five full time professional musicians based in
      the North West of England. The instrumentation in the band reflects the
      original line up for a German oompah band; Clarinet, Trumpet, Trombone,
      Sousaphone and Drums. If it is required, the band can also provide and
      drummer or rhythm section.

      Brasswürst began in 2012 when these five talented musicians graduated from
      the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and as a group they
      have had the opportunity to take centre stage all over the country. The
      band are always up for a laugh and get the crowds dancing, swaying,
      drinking and singing along to their favourite tunes. The band look forward
      to sharing this ‘Wunderbar’ experience with you. Prost!
